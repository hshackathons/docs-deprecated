# Ignition Code of Conduct

Adopted from StudentRND

Draft 3 - Last revised February 22, 2015

## Introduction

We like have fun and build a lot of cool things. At the same time, Ignition is an national community, and we need to make sure that our activities do not prevent others from having fun as well. As such, we have established a simple list of guidelines to provide a safe and welcoming experience that anyone can enjoy.

## All community members are expected to:

1. Act in a way that displays yourself as a positive role model.
1. Be humble, even when you're successful.
1. Respect, encourage, and support other students.
1. Help clean up after yourself and others.
1. Ensure the safety of yourself and other participants.

## Prohibited

Additionally, at all Ignition venues, events, and activities, community members may not engage in activities prohibited by US or local law, or depicting an act that would be illegal under US or local laws. This includes, but is not limited to:

1. Carrying guns, knives, or other weapons.
1. Using or being under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, illicit substances, and recreational drugs.
1. Using offensive language referring to people's gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or interests.
1. Using sexual language or imagery.
1. Insulting or harassing other community members. (See below)

## No means no. Stop means stop. Go away means go away.

Refrain from engaging in behavior that may threaten, harass, or put others at harm. Ask permission before touching other community members or their property, and respect that personâ€™s right to say no. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. **If you are being harassed, threatened, or harmed (or see it happening to someone else), and you do not feel comfortable handling it yourself, please report it to an appropriate contact as soon as possible.**

## Amendments

The Code of Conduct listed herein are subject to change at any time as deemed beneficial.

## Additional Information

Violations of our policies will generally be met with corrective action and we know that most may not have recalled the entirety or details of our code or policies. Our board will do everything possible to work with you in this event, but please understand that some behaviors will not be tolerated, even once (illegal drug use, assault, etc).
