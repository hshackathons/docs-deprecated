# Ignition Sanctioning Guidelines

Draft 1 - Last revised February 22, 2015

## Introduction

This document outlines the Ignition event sanctioning policies. Meeting all of these requirements does not necessarily guarantee sanctioning status for the event. We also tend to be flexible and are willing to make exceptions with our general requirements.

Ignition provides all sanctioned events with the following services to ease the lives of organizers and improve the attendee experience.

- **Expertise** - The Ignition team and our network of partners have worked with hundreds of events and has a unique insight into best practices for organizing a safe and welcoming experience that anyone can enjoy. Ignition works with sanctioned events to negotiate with school administrations, develop great sponsor materials, and solve on-the-fly problems like judging complications or scheduling conflicts.
- **Brand** - The Ignition brand acts as an important seal of approval and endorsement of quality for potential sponsors, attendees, and school administrations.
- **Swag** - All community members love swag. All officially sanctioned Ignition events have access to unique discounts on swag and resources.
- **Mentorship** - We will provide a network of mentors for your event.
- **Hardware** - Subject to location and availability: Sanctioned events gain access to Ignitionâ€™s roaming hardware lab that loans the latest, greatest devices to community members. The lab includes Thalmic Myos and more!

A full list of official perks for sanctioned events will always be available on the official Ignition Website.

**Sanctioning requirements are how Ignition maintains high quality standards for all events in the season. community members have very high expectations for Ignition sanctioned events.** The current sanctioned event requirements and policies are as follows:

## General Requirements

1. Event organizers must contact Ignition for sanctioning at least fourteen (14) days prior to their event for a listing on our website and thirty (30) days prior to their event for access to perks. Events must be advertised well enough in advance for community members in the area to learn about them.
1. To be sanctioned, events must have a confirmed date and location. Provisional sanctioning may be granted prior to this condition being met.
1. Events may not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, economic status, veteran status, disability, or age.
1. Sanctioned events must adopt, make available, and enforce an acceptable code of conduct to ensure a welcoming environment for everyone at the event. This code of conduct must extend to all attendees, including, but not limited to, community members, volunteers, organizers, sponsors, judges, and mentors.
1. Additionally, a clear and widely known reporting system must be available for incident reporting.
1. Every event must collect at least one (1) emergency contact per attendee.
1. Organizers grant Ignition the non-exclusive indefinite right to use event name, branding, and materials. Additionally, Ignition organizers non-exclusive right to use the Ignition name and brand in conjunction with the event.
1. Organizers will notify Ignition of any important information or event changes as soon as they occur or before if possible. Often, Ignition is able to assist when problems arise, but must receive sufficient notice for this to occur. 
1. Sanctioned events must have a minimum of twenty (20) community members from multiple schools.
1. All sanctioned events must make a good-will effort to advertise and make the application for admission publicly available. Secret or invite-only events without a straightforward and publicly known general application process are not eligible. Additionally, organizers must publish the criteria for admission to the event.
1. No event organizer may compete in an event he or she is organizing. This rule extends to judges, sponsors, and other staff.
1. Events in the United States may not serve alcohol to any attendees.
1. No corrective action may be taken without explicit approval from Ignition.

## Day of Event Requirements

1. Organizers must check in all attendees as they arrive at the event. Checking in attendees helps events run more smoothly and provides valuable opportunity to distribute information, swag, and event materials as well as ensure safety by knowing who is in attendance.
1. Ignition has the right to distribute swag, promotional materials, and prizes to event attendees.
1. Ignition has permission to record and publish photos and video of the event and reserves the right to produce commercial video content (this does not include TV news or sponsor/event recaps). Ignition will work with organizers to ensure compliance with appropriate university or venue video and photo policies.

## Deliverable Requirements

1. All event organizers must abide by appropriate Ignition Sanctioning Application, which states that they have read and will abide by the most current official sanctioning and ranking policies.
1. Either once attendee registration has been finalized or twenty-four (24) hours prior to the event (which ever occurs first), the event must submit registration data to Ignition. Ignition uses this data to compile statistics and communicate important information to attendees. The minimum required information is name, email, and school..
1. Collecting information about gender identity, year in school, major, birthday, food allergies, and special needs is optional, but recommended, as well.

## Violation of Policies

In the event of a violation of sanctioning guidelines, code of conduct, or other official Ignition regulation or policy, actions will be taken to rectify the issue. These actions will typically include, in order of severity, the following: 

1. Written Warning outlining the violation and how organizers can take action to resolve the issue.
1. Temporary Suspension from the current or future Ignition season(s).
1. Permanent Ban from all Ignition activities and future sanctioning.

Ignition believes in transparency. In the cases of suspensions or bans, a public statement will be made about what occurred to disqualify the given event. 

Ignition reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part. If you have any questions regarding these policies, please contact Ignition by e-mail at hello@hsignition.com.
